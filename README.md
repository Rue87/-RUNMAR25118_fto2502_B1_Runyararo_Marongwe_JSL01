# Kanban Task Management Board

## Description

This project is a functional and visually organized web-based Kanban task management board built with HTML and CSS. It provides a user-friendly interface for categorizing and tracking tasks through different stages of a workflow (To Do, Doing, Done). The design is responsive, adapting to various screen sizes to ensure a consistent experience across devices. This project serves as a solid foundation for future JavaScript-based interactive enhancements.

## Technologies Used

* HTML (for structuring the web page)
* CSS (for styling and layout, including responsive design with media queries)

## Features

### Created Features:

* **Task Creation (HTML Structure):** The HTML provides the structure for adding new tasks within the "To Do" column.
* **Columnar Organization:** Tasks are logically grouped into "TODO," "DOING," and "DONE" columns using HTML sections.
* **Static Task Representation:** The HTML includes sample task cards within each column to visually represent tasks.
* **Responsive Design (CSS):** The CSS incorporates media queries to adapt the layout for different screen sizes, including mobile devices.
* **Hidden Navigation (Mobile - CSS):** On smaller screens (up to 768px width), the left navigation sidebar is hidden using CSS.
* **Top Board Header (Mobile - CSS):** A board header with a title and logo (for mobile) is displayed at the top on smaller screens.
* **"Done" Column Hidden (Mobile - CSS):** The "DONE" column is initially hidden on mobile devices to focus on active tasks.
* **Visual Indicators (CSS):** Colored dots are implemented using CSS pseudo-elements to visually distinguish each column.
* **Custom Styling (CSS):** The project utilizes a custom font ('Plus Jakarta Sans') and a defined color scheme for a consistent and appealing visual presentation.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Rue87/RUNMAR25118_fto2502_B1_Runyararo_Marongwe_JSL01.git]
    cd RUNMAR25118_fto2502_B1_Runyararo_Marongwe_JSL01.git
    ```
2.  **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.**

## Usage Examples and Interaction (Static HTML/CSS)

As this version of the Kanban board is built with static HTML and CSS, the interaction is limited to viewing the pre-defined tasks and layout.

1.  **Viewing the Board:** Upon opening `index.html`, you will see the Kanban board with the "TODO," "DOING," and "DONE" columns, each containing sample task cards.
2.  **Mobile View:** If you open the `index.html` file on a device with a screen width of 768 pixels or less (or simulate this using your browser's developer tools), you will observe the responsive design:
    * The left navigation sidebar will be hidden.
    * A "Launch Career" header with a logo will appear at the top.
    * The task columns will be stacked vertically.
    * The "DONE" column will be initially hidden.

**Note:** The dynamic functionality of adding, moving, and managing tasks will be implemented in future iterations using JavaScript.
